<h1>Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology</h1>

<h3>Blockchain</h3>
 <p> The simplest blockchain definition? A reliable, difficult-to-hack record of transactions – and of who owns what. Blockchain is based on distributed ledger technology, which securely records information across a peer-to-peer network. Although it was originally created for trading Bitcoin, blockchain’s potential reaches far beyond cryptocurrency. Blockchain ledgers can include land titles, loans, identities, logistics manifests – almost anything of value. The technology is still new, but the potential impact it can have on business is exciting, and immense.

<h3>What is distributed ledger technology?</h3>
 <p> A distributed ledger is a database of transactions that is shared and synchronized across multiple computers and locations – without centralized control. Each party owns an identical copy of the record, which is automatically updated as soon as any additions are made.</p>

 <h3>  How does blockchain work?</h3>
    <p> A blockchain records data across a peer-to-peer network. Every participant can see the data and verify or reject it using consensus algorithms. Approved data is entered into the ledger as a collection of “blocks” and stored in a chronological “chain” that cannot be altered. </p>
    </div>

<div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:pink;">
<h3>What are smart contracts?</h3>
    <p> Smart contracts – self-executing agreements based on blockchain technology – automatically trigger actions or payments once conditions are met. In the near future, they will use real-time information, such as asset GPS data, to trigger an event, such as a transfer of ownership and funds. </p>

<h3>4 Types of Blockchain Networks</h3>
 <p> Of the four ways to establish a blockchain network – currently, consortium is the most accepted model for business.

<h3>Consortium blockchains</h3>
 <p> In a consortium blockchain, the consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected group – a group of corporations, for example. The right to read the blockchain and submit transactions to it may be public or restricted to participants. Consortium blockchains are considered to be “permissioned blockchains” and are best suited for use in business.

Semi-private blockchains
Semi-private blockchains are run by a single company that grants access to any user who satisfies pre-established criteria. Although not truly decentralized, this type of permissioned blockchain is appealing for business-to-business use cases and government applications.

 <h3>  Private blockchains</h3>
   <p> Private blockchains are controlled by a single organization that determines who can read it, submit transactions to it, and participate in the consensus process. Since they are 100% centralized, private blockchains are useful as sandbox environments, but not for actual production.</p>
    </div>

<div class="col-sm-3" id="blockchainnetty" style="background-color:pink;">
<h3>Public blockchains</h3>
    <p> Anyone can read a public blockchain, send transactions to it, or participate in the consensus process. They are considered to be “permissionless.” Every transaction is public, and users can remain anonymous. Bitcoin and Ethereum are prominent examples of public blockchains.
